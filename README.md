# TDD Training Katas

## What is this?
This repository contains TDD kata exercises as requirements and guidance on
how to get started with each.

The objectives for each kata are detailed in the guidance with suggestions for
tools to use.

While there are correct results for the supplied tests, there is not necessarily
a single, correct solution for solving the problem presented in the requirements.

## Overall objectives
The katas are intended to be completed within a limited period (one to two
hours) and for repetition. On each repeat of a kata the solution should be a
clean sheet. It is the process that is important, not the solution but some
variety is needed to maintain interest.

A corner stone of the katas are that through repetition the katas become
memorized and can be repeated without the need for the requirements document.
Working through the kata in a managed session is only part of the story, it is
important to practice each kata over and over. Repeating a single kata is vital
to the process of successfully memorising the kata and the TDD cycle. Moving on
to another kata must be a carefully considered move.

The language used to solve a kata is not prescribed, it is up to the student to
decide the best choice, it is however easier to run if all students in the room
are using the same language so that work can be shared.

It is assumed that any student following a kata has at least a minimal
understanding of the language in use and how to write code. Working in pairs
is the recommended mode of working and helps any student that is not confident
in writing code.

Ultimately the students must be able to follow a rapid red-green-refactor cycle
to quickly implement a solution that satisfies the requirements of the kata. The
technologies used in the test are a significant consideration - the katas are
about learning the TDD cycle first and foremost, rather than learning how to use
testing methods beyond the immediate unit tests.

The exercises need to be graded from beginner to advanced with scope to
introduce more complex testing topics than simply writing unit tests. For example
introducing mocks and spies. Where this is necessary, supporting tools and code
are needed to avoid having to create two solutions.

The complexity of a kata relates more to the size and number of requirements than
the code that needs to be written - a beginner kata should be achievable, with
practice, in just a short period.

## Lessons on TDD, Syllabus
Alongside the katas are a set of short lessons on what Test Drive Development *is*
and how it fits within the testing pyramid and agile development. The lessons are
meant to be light and none of them should take more than a few minutes to read
through - they also present an idealised, idiosyncratic approach to TDD. Further
reading is strongly recommended.
