# TDD Training Katas

## What is this?
This repository contains TDD kata exercises as requirements and guidance on
how to get started with each.

The objectives for each kata are detailed in the guidance with suggestions for
tools to use.

While there are correct results for the supplied tests, there is not necessarily
a single, correct solution for solving the problem presented in the requirements.

## Overall objectives
The katas are intended to be completed within a limited period (one to two
hours) and for repetition. On each repeat of a kata the solution should be a
clean sheet. It is the process that is important, not the solution but some
variety is needed to maintain interest.

A corner stone of the katas are that through repetition the katas become
memorized and can be repeated without the need for the requirements document.
Working through the kata in a managed session is only part of the story, it is
important to practice each kata over and over. Repeating a single kata is vital,
moving on to another kata must be a carefully considered move.

The language used to solve a kata is not prescribed, it is up to the student to
decide the best choice, it is however easier to run if all students in the room
are using the same language so that work can be shared.

Ultimately the students must be able to follow a rapid red-green-refactor cycle
to quickly implement a solution.

The exercises need to be graded from beginner to advanced with scope to
introduce more complex TDD topics than simply writing unit tests. For example
introducing mocks and spies - where this is necessary, supporting tools and code
are needed to avoid having to create two solutions.
