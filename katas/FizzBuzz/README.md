# Fizz Buzz

## Grade - Total Beginner

## Introduction
Fizz Buzz is an ideal, simple introduction to TDD with the emphasis on the
process rather than the implementation. There is no input to process, just an
output to the console.

## Requirements

1. Output a list of numbers from 1 to 100 to the console

2. For each multiple of 3 output "Fizz" instead of the number

3. For each multiple of 5 output "Buzz" instead of the number

4. For multiples of 3 and 5 output "Fizzbuzz" instead of the number
